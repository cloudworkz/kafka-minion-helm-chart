# Kafka Minion Helm Chart

Helm chart for deployment of Kafka Minion

## Intalling helm chart

```
helm repo add kafka-minion https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudworkz/kafka-minion-helm-chart/master
helm repo update
helm install --name=kafka-minion kafka-minion/kafka-minion
```

## Chart configuration

**NOTE:** You may want to adapt the readiness probe values depending on your kafka cluster size. To ensure high availability during rolling updates Kafka Minion marks itself ready only after it has completely processed the `__consumer_offsets` topic. By default it has up to 10 minutes and 10 seconds to do so, then it's getting killed by Kubernetes.

## SASL/SSL Setup

When configuring SASL or TLS you can either provide the secretname of an existing secret **or** pass the contents as values. When you choose to create the secrets on your own, please make sure you comply with the key names defined in this chart:

#### SASL

Key names are `username` and `password` by default.

```yml
type: Opaque
data:
  username:
  password:
```

#### TLS

Key names are `tls.ca`, `tls.key`, `tls.crt` and `passphrase` by default.

```yml
type: Opaque
data:
  tls.ca:
  tls.key:
  tls.crt:
  passphrase:
```
